        <h1>Difference Between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2.0</h1>
        <h3>HTTP DEFINITION</h3>
        <p>
        <ul>
        <li>Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application layer protocol in the 
            Internet protocol suite model for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia 
            information systems.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web, where 
            hypertext documents include hyperlinks to other resources that the user can easily access
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Development of HTTP was initiated by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN in 1989.The behavior of a
             client and a server using the first HTTP protocol version that was named 0.9.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            first version of HTTP protocol soon evolved into a more elaborated version 
            that was the first draft toward a far future version 1.0.
        </li><br>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3>HTTP1.1</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    HTTP/1 was finalized and fully documented (as version 1.0) in 1996.
                    It evolved (as version 1.1) in 1997 and then its specifications were updated in 1999 and in 2014.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    HTTP/2, published in 2015, provides a more efficient expression of HTTP's semantics "on the wire". 
                    It is now used by more than 46% of websites and supported by almost all web browsers (96% of users).
                    It is also supported by major web servers over Transport Layer Security (TLS) using an 
                    Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) extension where TLS 1.2 or newer is required.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    In HTTP/1.1 instead a TCP connection can be reused to make multiple resource requests
                     (i.e. of HTML pages, frames, images, scripts, stylesheets, etc.)
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    HTTP/1.1 communications therefore experience less latency as the establishment 
                    of TCP connections presents considerable overhead, specially under high traffic conditions.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    The binary framing layer is Unlike in HTTP/1.1
                </li><br>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3>HTTP2.0</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    HTTP/2 is a revision of previous HTTP/1.1 in order to maintain the same 
                    client–server model and the same protocol methods.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    to use a compressed binary representation of metadata (HTTP headers) instead of a
                     textual one, so that headers require much less space;
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    to use a single TCP/IP (usually encrypted) connection per accessed server domain 
                    instead of 2 to 8 TCP/IP connections;
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    to use one or more bidirectional streams per TCP/IP connection in which HTTP requests and responses
                     are broken down and transmitted in small packets to almost solve the problem of the HOLB (head of line blocking)
                </li><br>
                <li>   
                    to add a push capability to allow server application to send data to clients whenever 
                    new data is available (without forcing clients to request periodically new data to 
                    server by using polling methods).
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    HTTP/2 communications therefore experience much less latency and, 
                    in most cases, even more speed than HTTP/1.1 communications.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    HTTP/2 uses a more advanced compression method called <strong>HPACK</strong> 
                    that eliminates redundant information in HTTP header packets. This eliminates a few bytes from every HTTP packet
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    HTTP/2 uses a binary framing layer. This layer encapsulates messages – converted 
                    to its binary equivalent – while making sure that its HTTP semantics 
                    (method details, header information, etc.) remain untamed.
